      <h2 style = "color:#175f3e">Technology has both positive and negative environmental effects <br> On the one hand, it has enabled significant advances in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable agriculture <br> among other areas <br> On the other hand, it has also contributed to a number of environmental challenges, including:</h2>
      <ul style = "color:#175f3e">
        <li>E-waste: The rapid pace of technological innovation has led to a growing amount of electronic waste, or e-waste, which can contain hazardous materials and contribute to pollution. </li>
        
        <li>Energy consumption: The production and use of technology requires significant amounts of energy, which can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.
        </li>
        
        <li>Resource depletion: The production of technology requires the use of a variety of natural resources, including rare earth metals, which can be difficult to extract and can contribute to <br> environmental degradation.</li>

        <li>Pollution: The production and use of technology can contribute to air, water, and soil pollution, particularly in areas where environmental regulations are weak.</li>

        <li>Land use: The construction of technology infrastructure, such as data centers and cell towers, can require significant amounts of land, which can contribute to deforestation and habitat loss.</li>
