      <h2 style = "color:#175f3e">The development and use of AI raises important ethical questions, such as issues of bias and privacy <br> that must be carefully considered.</h2>
      <ul style = "color:#175f3e">
        <li>Bias: AI algorithms can perpetuate and amplify existing biases in society, such as racial and gender biases, if not properly designed and tested. </li>
        
        <li>Privacy: AI systems often collect and process large amounts of personal data, which can raise concerns about privacy and data protection.</li>
        
        <li>Transparency: AI systems can be opaque, making it difficult for users to understand how decisions are being made and to identify potential biases.</li>

        <li>Weaponization: The use of AI in military and defense applications raises ethical questions about the development and use of autonomous weapons.</li>

      <ul style = "color:#175f3e">
        <li>AI is also not neutral: AI-based decisions are susceptible to inaccuracies, discriminatory outcomes, embedded or inserted bias. </li>
        
        <li>AI decisions are not always intelligible to humans.</li>
