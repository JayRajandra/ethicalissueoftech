      <h2 style = "color:#175f3e"> Automated decision making (ADM) systems, which use algorithms and machine learning to make decisions, <br>can raise a number of ethical issues, including:</h2>
      <ul style = "color:#175f3e">

        <li>Bias: ADM systems can perpetuate and amplify existing biases in society, such as racial and gender biases, if not properly designed and tested.
        </li>
        
        <li>Privacy: ADM systems often collect and process large amounts of personal data, which can raise concerns about privacy and data protection.</li>
        
        <li>Fairness: ADM systems can make decisions that have a significant impact on people's lives, such as in hiring or lending decisions, and there are ethical questions around ensuring that these <br> decisions are fair and unbiased.
        
        <li>Autonomy: As ADM systems become more advanced, they may be able to make decisions and take actions without human intervention, raising questions about who is responsible for their actions.</li>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style = "color:#175f3e">Overall, it is important to ensure that ADM systems are designed and implemented in a way that is ethical and transparent, <br>and that they are subject to appropriate oversight and accountability mechanisms.</h2>
        <p style = "color:#175f3e"> The video below shows an example of ADM specifically in cars and the ethical issues of it.</p>
